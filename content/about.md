Hi! My name is Grace Lawley. I am a first-year PhD student in the Computer Science & Electrical Engineering [(CSEE)](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/basic-science-departments/csee/) program of the Center for Spoken Language Understanding [(CSLU)](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/research/centers-institutes/center-for-spoken-language-understanding/) at Oregon Health & Science University [(OHSU)](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/) in Portland, Oregon. 

I graduated from Lewis & Clark College in May of 2017 with a BA in Mathematics. My interests include math (...surprise! more specifically, discrete math), data science, computational linguistics, autism spectrum disorder, and the programming language R. 

My research involves detecting and quantifying atypical word use in the language of children with autism. Most recently, I have been diving into corpus linguistics and learning about methods for compiling and normalizing corpora. I am currently working on compiling a children's speech corpus to use in my research.
